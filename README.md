### SCREEN - 01
The application allows observers to start an observation. To help first time users of the Android application, icons are strategically placed at the top right corner (information icon and help icon after the ‘Select your type of observation’). On selecting the information icon from the top right corner, it gives the observer more information about the current screen in the Android application (figure below). On selecting the help icon, the observer is able to understand the overview of types of observations that can be observed.

### SCREEN - 02
Once the observer is ready to start an observation by selecting a type of observation from the home screen, the notification screen (figure below) gives them step-by-step overview on how to proceed and the steps that can be expected before submitting the observation. Once again, to give users a quick overview of the current screen in the Android application, an information icon has been placed at the top right corner of the screen. This will help observer in understanding the information presented in the current screen.

### SCREEN - 03
Once the observer confirms that pollinators visited during this particular observation session, the application allows observers to annotate the pollinators (figure below). The observer is required to search pollinator. As the observer starts typing, the application presents with a list of pollinators. As soon as the pollinator is selected, it takes the observer to next level, where another list is presented. The observer can drill down further by selecting type of pollinator from the list. The observer can enter number of pollinators observed during the session and associate images of the pollinators.

### SCREEN - 04
If the type of observation selected is Stationary Count, the application asks the observer to annotate the plants (figure below). The application screen works similar to previous screen, Identify pollinators.

The observer is ready to submit the observation at this point. During this session, the pictures of pollinators, location of observation, plants and pollinators have been identified. The summary screen presents the observer with start and end date time of the observation session. The count of plants and pollinators identified during this session (figure below).
